# React Github Profile Finder

Github Profile Finder app made with React.js and Tailwind CSS.
- Main functionalities made by learning along and following React Front to Back course by Brad Traversy (design by me)
- Using react-router, async/await and initially class components and core React features (later refactored using function components, Hooks and Context API)
- Currently making it fully responsive
